# esd-workshop

This repository contains presentation slides for the workshop contained in the Email Self-defense guide of the Free Software Foundation. The guide can be found at https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org

# Prerequisites

The figures present are in the vecotor format svg and converted to pdf files by `inkscape`. 

The source codes present are in the LaTeX format, hence a LaTeX compiler is required, e.g. `pdflatex esd-workshop.tex`.

For easy compilation use `make` that both converts the prerequisite svg files, and compiles the tex files into the final `esd-workshop.pdf` file.
